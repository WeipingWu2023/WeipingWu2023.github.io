    <h4></h4>
  <div class="line">A few moments ago, before I walked onstage, I was aware that there was this story playing out in my head.</div>
  <div class="line">It was actually a dance between two stories.</div>
  <div class="line">One story was noticing the size of this audience and the cameras that are around, and was telling me that now would not be a good time to trip over a shoelace or forget any lines.</div>
  <div class="line">And the other story in my head was telling me to be grateful for this opportunity.</div>
  <div class="line">Go out, relish the experience, and have fun.</div>
  <div class="line">I was aware that whichever story took hold might impact the next 12 minutes of my life and determine how this talk unfolds.</div>
  <div class="line">Therapists and psychologists tell us that the stories we tell ourselves play a fundamental role in how we interact with the world around us.</div>
  <div class="line">Some people tell themselves that they are not enough.</div>
  <div class="line">Other people tell themselves that they're impostors.</div>
  <div class="line">And if you've ever seen the auditions of a television singing competition, some people tell themselves they're a little better than they actually are.</div>
  <div class="line">But apart from the individual stories we tell ourselves, all of us are also taking part in larger, collective stories that shape our behavior as a species.</div>
  <div class="line">A collective story enables people in India to treat cows as sacred, while people in America cram cows into feedlots.</div>
  <div class="line">Our internal and external worlds are full of stories that shape our behaviors.</div>
  <div class="line">Today, I want to talk about a collective story that most people aren't even aware they're inhabiting.</div>
  <div class="line">It is a collective story that tells us that human beings are separate and superior to nature.</div>
  <div class="line">It is a story that has taken us so close to the brink of an unimaginable crisis that our survival now depends on telling a new story.</div>
  <div class="line">So ... Once upon a time, in a land far away -- and right here, actually, on the lands that we're gathered today, the majority of people on planet Earth had a deep reverence and respect for nature.</div>
  <div class="line">They saw very little separation between themselves and the world around them.</div>
  <div class="line">Many cultures saw nature as a giving parent.</div>
  <div class="line">The plants and the animals were their relatives.</div>
  <div class="line">Indigenous Australians saw themselves as custodians of the land, while the ancient Chinese considered themselves reverent guests of nature.</div>
  <div class="line">Even prominent figures of Rome, like Ovid and Seneca, argued that mining shouldn't be permissible, as it was too abusive to the natural world.</div>
  <div class="line">But then, things started to change.</div>
  <div class="line">A new craze called Christianity began to take hold.</div>
    <div class="line">Word spread that their one God sat above and outside nature, and that God had made people in his own image and given them dominion over the Earth.</div>
    <div class="line">"Sounds alright," said the people, passing on the news to friends and relatives, missionaries, kings.</div>
    <div class="line">"The world was made for the sake of man, that it may serve him," said the bishop of Paris in the early 12th century.</div>
    <div class="line">The Christian craze had now infiltrated Europe and was beginning its march into the Americas.</div>
    <div class="line">"But wait, there's more," said a couple of fancy-looking men in the early 1600s.</div>
    <div class="line">They told the people that they were from the Scientific Revolution, and that they could empower the people even further.</div>
    <div class="line">"We must hound nature in her wanderings," said the first man -- Francis Bacon, the father of modern science.</div>
    <div class="line">"We must find a way, at length, into her inner chambers.</div>
    <div class="line">We must reveal the secrets still locked in nature's bosom.</div>
    <div class="line">Make her your slave, subdue her, shake her to her foundations."</div>
    <div class="line">"Yes," said the men. "It sounds alright."</div>
    <div class="line">The second man then chimed in.</div>
    <div class="line">His name was René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy.</div>
    <div class="line">He confirmed to the people that, yes, they were superior to nature and added that animals were mindless machines to be mastered and exploited at will.</div>
    <div class="line">"Well, that's a relief," said the people.</div>
    <div class="line">"Now, we don't have to feel so bad about whipping our oxen."</div>
    <div class="line">The influence of these two men, coupled with the religious craze, meant that nature was no longer seen as a living thing to be revered and respected, but instead as a machine to be manipulated for the benefits of mankind.</div>
    <div class="line">This was a new and exciting story that set free natural resources for humans to achieve social and economic progress, even if obtained through violent and suppressive acts.</div>
    <div class="line">This new story was particularly enticing to the emerging capitalists of the time, because a nature devoid of reverence and respect was much easier to commodify.</div>
    <div class="line">And commodify they did.</div>
    <div class="line">The humans went to work, entering and penetrating all of those inner chambers.</div>
    <div class="line">They tunneled her bosom for coal and metals, they scraped and plowed over her skin with their tractors.</div>
    <div class="line">They took chain saws to her forests of follicles, and they filled her waters with their waste.</div>
    <div class="line">The new story had spread across the globe.</div>
    <div class="line">Humans had asserted their dominance, they built wondrous things and improved the lives of billions of people, particularly in specific regions.</div>
    <div class="line">Until one day ... their scientists began to notice.</div>
    <div class="line">"Her animals are decreasing."</div>
    <div class="line">"Her atmosphere is heating."</div>
    <div class="line">"The soils are eroding."</div>
    <div class="line">"Our research is foreboding."</div>
    <div class="line">But still, the humans carried on.</div>
    <div class="line">You see, they couldn't hear the scientists, because the facts don't matter much if they don't fit the story.</div>
    <div class="line">And the story was deeply embedded now.</div>
    <div class="line">In 2019, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency in the US opposes regulations because, he says, "We have a responsibility to harvest the natural resources that we've been blessed with."</div>
    <div class="line">A prominent evangelist tells his followers that refusing to use fossil fuels hurts God's feelings.</div>
    <div class="line">The story was so embedded that the humans' nightly news bulletins measured their success by financial metrics alone, while the living world that allowed the gains in those metrics was being eviscerated out of sight.</div>
    <div class="line">And the story was so embedded that when researchers looked at the names of trees, birds, flowers, and other keywords relating to nature used across millions of books, songs, and movies from 1900 to 2014 ...</div>
    <div class="line">They found a dramatic decline in the use of those words across that period.</div>
    <div class="line">The humans were spending seven hours a day on their screens.</div>
    <div class="line">So not only were they experiencing fewer stories and actual experiences of nature ...</div>
    <div class="line">But they were being bombarded by up to 10,000 advertisements a day, largely for products that are inflicting even more ecological damage.</div>
    <div class="line">Nature was being hounded in her wanderings.</div>
    <div class="line">And yet, the humans remain trapped in their story.</div>
    <div class="line">Trapped in their cultural programming ... like goldfish in a tank, unaware of the unfolding chaos beyond the colored pebbles and the artificial logs.</div>
    <div class="line">So when those same scientists resorted to blocking traffic and tying themselves to poles or screaming that the Amazon rainforest, the most spectacular of all her forests, was nearing a tipping point that would turn her into a savanna ... still, the humans did nothing.</div>
    <div class="line">Because to them, those trees ... those trees that were home to thousands of species of animals and millions of species of insects, those trees that sent nutrients to each other via underground fungal networks ... those trees that transpired moisture into the air to create rainfall that would feed crops in countries thousands of kilometers away ...</div>
    <div class="line">Those trees were just ... timber for decking.</div>
    <div class="line">Pulp for toilet paper.</div>
    <div class="line">Or space for more cows.</div>
    <div class="line">Those trees were worth more dead than alive ... because that's what the story had told them.</div>
    <div class="line">But then, something remarkable happened.</div>
    <div class="line">It started with the children, who began to skip school and take to the streets.</div>
    <div class="line">It started with the farmers who chose to stop fighting nature and instead rebuild their soils.</div>
    <div class="line">It started when the Indigenous people, who, for centuries, had been reminding everybody of their story, were finally being listened to.</div>
    <div class="line">And it started when nature herself, through fires and storms, through droughts and rising waters, forced her way back into the people's lives and demanded their respect.</div>
    <div class="line">A new, regenerative story about human beings and nature was emerging.</div>
    <div class="line">But of course, it wasn't a new story at all. It was the retelling of an old story. But this time, the old story was supported by the science.</div>
    <div class="line">And it was telling the people that every breath they took was dependent on trees and phytoplankton.</div>
    <div class="line">And that trillions of bacteria and fungi lived on them and in them and kept them alive.</div>
    <div class="line">Viewing the natural world as separate from humans was now empirically false. Humans are nature.</div>
    <div class="line">But the science was also telling them that plants could see, they could smell, hear ... they could learn and store memories.</div>
    <div class="line">That dolphins gossiped and spoke in local dialects, elephants held ceremonies for dead relatives, grasshoppers could turn into locusts and back again in a matter of hours, and that termites had built an underground metropolis the size of the United Kingdom.</div>
    <div class="line">The same scientific inquiry that had led to domination and extraction had gone so deep into nature's bosom that it was revealing her secrets.</div>
    <div class="line">And her secrets were divulging that she was anything but mechanistic.</div>
    <div class="line">That she was deserving of the utmost reverence and respect.</div>
    <div class="line">And that the original story had been right all along.</div>
    <div class="line">And so perhaps now, the humans would no longer refer to nature as an unruly female to be tamed or an "it" to be exploited ... but would refer to nature simply ... as kin.</div>
    <div class="line">Nobody knows how this new but old story ends because it is still being written.</div>
    <div class="line">But if it is to have the Hollywood ending, if we are to break free from our cultural programming and pull off the miraculous comeback when all seems lost, then the new but old story will have to be rapidly spread throughout the culture.</div>
    <div class="line">It will need to be embedded into all levels of curriculum, particularly at the early stages, so children can see the world as a living system, not as a machine full of stocks and commodities.</div>
    <div class="line">It will need to inform a redesign of the economy, so it values nature and reflects the true environmental costs of the materials we all use.</div>
    <div class="line">It will need to revamp the nightly news bulletins so we'd measure soil health, atmospheric pollution, species loss alongside the financial metrics.</div>
    <div class="line">And crucially, the new but old story will need to be amplified by the storytellers.</div>
    <div class="line">The musicians, the artists, those that can create the emotional connection to the living world once again, and paint visions of a nature-filled future that people can see and feel and strive for.</div>
    <div class="line">Because stories shape culture.</div>
    <div class="line">Culture shapes leaders, leaders shape policies, and policies shape the system.</div>
    <div class="line">And perhaps, just perhaps, one day ... a few hundred years from now ... historians will look back to this moment, and they'll see that, amongst the chaos and the nihilism and the fear and the extinctions, there were groups of people who chose to turn the page and begin to write a new chapter for humanity.</div>
    <div class="line">A chapter full of diverse characters, from a range of professions and places, who came together to create a thriving, regenerative, ecological future.</div>
